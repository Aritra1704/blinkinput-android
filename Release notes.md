# Release notes

## 2.1.0
- fixed crash that occurred when detection image was being sent from native to Java
- fixed issue that cause irrationaly refusal to scan anything on high-end devices
- fixed bug in scanning 1D barcodes with ZXing when scanning region was set
	- the bug caused not to honor set region
- when embedding `RecognizerView` into custom scan activity, you no longer need to take care of whether runtime permissions are set or not. You can now simply pass all lifecycle events to `RecognizerView` and if camera permission is denied, a new callback method `onCameraPermissionDenied` of `CameraEventsListener` will be invoked to give you chance to ask user for permissions
	- please refer to updated demo apps for example of new callback
- **IMPORTANT** - `onScanningDone` callback method does not automatically pause scanning loop anymore. As soon as `onScanningDone` method ends, scanning will be automatically resumed without resetting state
	- if you need to reset state, please call `resetRecognitionState` in your implementation of `onScanningDone`
	- if you need to have scanning paused after `onScanningDone` ends, please call `pauseScanning` in your implementation of `onScanningDone`. Do not forget to call `resumeScanning` to resume scanning after it has been paused.
- `pauseScanning` and `resumeScanning` calls are now counted, i.e. if you call `pauseScanning` twice, you will also need to call `resumeScanning` twice to actually resume scanning
	- this is practical if you show multiple onboarding views over camera and you want the scanning paused while each is shown and you do not know in which order they will be dismissed. Now you can simply call `pauseScanning` on showing the onboarding view and `resumeScanning` on dismissing it, regardless of how many onboarding views you have
	- if you want to show onboarding help first time your scan activity starts, you can call `setInitialScanningPaused(true)` which will ensure that first time camera is started, the scanning will not automatically start - you will need to call `resumeScanning` to start scanning after your onboarding view is dismissed
- added support for `x86_64` architecture


## 2.0.0
- new API which is easier to understand, but is not backward compatible. Please check [README](README.md) and updated demo applications for more information.
- removed support for ARMv7 devices which do not support NEON SIMD
	- this enabled us to increase recognition speed at cost of not supporting old devices like those using NVIDIA Tegra 2
	- you can check [this article](https://microblink.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/206113151-Removing-support-for-devices-without-NEON-SIMD-extensions) for more information about NEON and why we use it
- added official support for Android 6.0 and it's runtime camera permissions
	- if using provided _BlinkOCRActivity_, the logic behind asking user to give camera permission is handled internally
	- if integrating using custom UI, you are required to ask user to give you permission to use camera. To make this easier, we have provided a _CameraPermissionManager_ class which does all heavylifting code about managing states when asking user for camera permission. Refer to demo apps to see how it is used.
- BlinkOCR now depends on appcompat-v7 library, instead of full android-support library.
	- even older versions of BlinkOCR required only features from appcompat-v7 so we now decided to make appcompat-v7 as dependency because it is much smaller than full support library and is also default dependency of all new Android apps.
- completely rewritten JNI layer which now gives much lower overhead in communication between Java and native code
	- in our internal tests, this yielded up to 3 times better performance in OCR
- fixed issue with Nexus 5X upside down camera
- when using DirectAPI, recognized Bitmap is not recycled anymore so it can be reused


## 1.9.0
- fixed auto-exposure bug on Nexus 6
- improved OCR quality and performance
- fixed autofocus issue on devices that do not support continuous autofocus
- support for defining camera video resolution preset
	- to define video resolution preset via Intent, use `BlinkOCRActivity.EXTRAS_CAMERA_VIDEO_PRESET`
	- to define video resolution preset on `RecognizerView`, use method `setVideoResolutionPreset`

## 1.8.0
- added support for scanning barcodes
- fixed race condition causing memory leak or rare crashes
- fixed `NullPointerException` in `BaseCameraView.dispatchTouchEvent`
- fixed bug that caused returning scan result from old video frame
- fixed `NullPointerException` in camera2 management
- fixed rare race condition in gesture recognizer
- fixed segmentation fault on recognizer reconfiguration operation
- fixed freeze when camera was being quickly turned on and off
- fixed bug in IBAN parser that caused not to parse IBAN's that contain letters, such as in UK, Ireland or Netherlands
- ensured `RecognizerView` lifecycle methods are called on UI thread
- ensure `onCameraPreviewStarted` is not called if camera is immediately closed after start before the call should have taken place
- ensure `onScanningDone` is not called after `RecognizerView` has been paused, even if it had result ready just before pausing
- default maximum number of chars in `raw parser` is now 3000 (it used to be 600)
- it is now possible to define maximum allowed number of char recognition variants via `BlinkOCREngineOptions`. Default value is `0`.
- when calling `onDisplayOcrResult` callback, make sure OCR char recognition variants are not sent to Java - this is both slow and not required
- added support for using _BlinkOCR_ as camera capture API. To do that, implement following:
	- when using `RecognizerView` do not call `setRecognitionSettings` or call it with `null` or empty array
	- implement `ImageListener` interface and set the listener with `setImageListener`
	- as a reminder - you can process video frames obtained that way using direct API method `recognizeImageWithSettings`
- reorganized integration demo apps
	- `BlinkOCRSegmentDemo` shows how to use simple Intent-based API to scan little text segments. It also shows you how to create a custom scan activity for scanning little text segments.
	- `BlinkOCRFullScreen` shows how to perform full camera frame generic OCR, how to draw OCR results on screen and how to obtain `OcrResult` object for further processing. This app also shows how to scan Code128 or Code39 barcode on same screen that is used for OCR.
	- `BlinkOCRDirectAPI` shows how to perform OCR of `Bitmap` object obtained from camera
	- all demo apps now use Maven integration method because it is much easier than importing AAR manually
- **removed** parsers specific to country standards - these are now available as part of our [PhotoPay](https://microblink.com/photopay) product
	- removed croatian parsers
	- removed serbian parsers
	- removed macedonian parsers
	- removed swedish parsers

- [recognizeBitmap](https://blinkocr.github.io/blinkocr-android/com/microblink/view/recognition/RecognizerView.html#recognizeBitmap(android.graphics.Bitmap, com.microblink.view.recognition.ScanResultListener)) method can now receive orientation of given [Bitmap](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap.html)

- removed method `resumeScanningWithoutStateReset` - method `resumeScanning` of [RecognizerView](https://blinkocr.github.io/blinkocr-android/com/microblink/view/recognition/RecognizerView.html) now receives `boolean` indicating whether internal state should be reset

## 1.6.0

	- on devices that support it, utilize [Camera2 API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/package-summary.html) for better per frame camera control
