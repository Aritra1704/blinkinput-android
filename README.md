# <a name="intro"></a> Android _BlinkOCR_ integration instructions

The package contains Android Archive (AAR) that contains everything you need to use _BlinkOCR_ library. Besides AAR, package also contains a demo project that contains following modules:



 - BlinkOCRApp demonstrates integration of BlinkOCR component
 
_BlinkOCR_ is supported on Android SDK version 8 (Android 2.2) or later.


# <a name="quickStart"></a> Quick Start

## <a name="quickDemo"></a> Quick start with demo app

1. Open Android Studio.
2. In Quick Start dialog choose _Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)_.
3. In File dialog select _BlinkOCRDemo_ folder.
4. Wait for project to load. If Android studio asks you to reload project on startup, select `Yes`.

## <a name="quickIntegration"></a> Quick integration of _BlinkOCR_ into your app

1. In Android Studio menu, click _File_, select _New_ and then select _Module_.
2. In new window, select _Import .JAR or .AAR Package_, and click _Next_.
3. In _File name_ field, enter the path to _LibRecognizer.aar_ and click _Finish_.
4. If you plan to use ProGuard, add following lines to your `proguard-rules.pro`:
	
	```
	-keep class com.microblink.** { *; }
	-keepclassmembers class com.microblink.** {
		*;
	}
	-dontwarn android.hardware.**
	-dontwarn android.support.v4.**
	```
	
## <a name="eclipseIntegration"></a> Eclipse integration instructions

We do not provide Eclipse integration demo apps. We encourage you to use Android Studio. However, if you still want to use Eclipse, you will need to convert AAR archive to Eclipse library project format. You can do this by doing the following:

1. In Eclipse, create a new _Android library project_ in your workspace.
2. Clear the `src` and `res` folders.
3. Unzip the `LibRecognizer.aar` file. You can rename it to zip and then unzip it or use any tool.
4. Copy the `classes.jar` to `libs` folder of your Eclipse library project. If `libs` folder does not exist, create it.
5. Copy `android-support-v4.jar` to `libs` folder of your Eclipse library project. You can find `android-support-v4.jar` in `/path/to/your/android/SDK/extras/android/support/v4/android-support-v4.jar`.
6. Copy the contents of `jni` folder to `libs` folder of your Eclipse library project.
7. Replace the `res` folder on library project with the `res` folder of the `LibRecognizer.aar` file.

You’ve already created the project that contains almost everything you need. Now let’s see how to configure your project to reference this library project.

1. In the project you want to use the library (henceforth, "target project") add the library project as a dependency
2. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file inside `LibRecognizer.aar` file and make sure to copy all permissions, features and activities to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file of the target project.
3. Clean and Rebuild your target project

## <a name="mavenIntegration"></a> How to integrate _BlinkOCR_ into your project using Maven

Maven repository for _BlinkOCR_ SDK is: [http://maven.microblink.com](http://maven.microblink.com).

### Using gradle
In your build.gradle you first need to add _BlinkOCR_ maven repository to repositories list:

```
repositories {
	maven { url 'http://maven.microblink.com' }
}
```

After that, you just need to add _BlinkOCR_ as a dependency to your application:

```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.microblink:blinkocr:1.0.0'
}
```

### Using android-maven-plugin

Open your pom.xml file and add these directives as appropriate:

```xml
<repositories>
   	<repository>
       	<id>MicroblinkRepo</id>
       	<url>http://maven.microblink.com</url>
   	</repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		  <groupId>com.microblink</groupId>
		  <artifactId>blinkocr</artifactId>
		  <version>1.0.0</version>
  	</dependency>
<dependencies>
```

Maven dependency requires android-maven-plugin version 4.0.0 (AAR support is required).

# <a name="integrationInstructions"></a> _BlinkOCR_ integration instructions

This section will cover details in _BlinkOCR_ integration. First part will discuss the methods for checking whether _BlinkOCR_ is supported on current device. Second part will describe how to embed `RecognizerView` into your activity and third part will describe how to use direct API to recognize directly android bitmaps without the need of camera.

## <a name="supportCheck"></a> Checking if _BlinkOCR_ is supported

### _BlinkOCR_ requirements
Even before starting the scan activity, you should check if _BlinkOCR_ is supported on current device. In order to be supported, device needs to have camera. 

Android 2.3 is the minimum android version on which _BlinkOCR_ is supported, but if required we may support even Android 2.2 devices, however additional testing on those devices will be required.

Camera video preview resolution also matters. In order to perform successful scans, camera preview resolution cannot be too low. _BlinkOCR_ requires minimum 480p camera preview resolution in order to perform scan. It must be noted that camera preview resolution is not the same as the video record resolution, although on most devices those are the same. However, there are some devices that allow recording of HD video (720p resolution), but do not allow high enough camera preview resolution (for example, [Sony Xperia Go](http://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_go-4782.php) supports video record resolution at 720p, but camera preview resolution is only 320p - _BlinkOCR_ does not work on that device).

_BlinkOCR_ is native application, written in C++ and available for multiple platforms. Because of this, _BlinkOCR_ cannot work on devices that have obscure hardware architectures. We have compiled _BlinkOCR_ native code for `armeabi`, `armeabi-v7a` and `x86` [ABIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) because those architectures cover almost entire Android device market (actually more than 98% of devices use `armeabi-v7a` ABI). See [Processor architecture considerations](#archConsider) for more information about native libraries in _BlinkOCR_ and instructions how to disable certain architectures in order to reduce the size of final app.

### Checking for _BlinkOCR_ support in your app
To check whether the _BlinkOCR_ is supported on the device, you can do it in the following way:
	
```java
// check if BlinkOCR is supported on the device
RecognizerCompatibilityStatus supportStatus = RecognizerCompatibility.getRecognizerCompatibilityStatus(this);
if(status == RecognizerCompatibilityStatus.RECOGNIZER_SUPPORTED) {
	Toast.makeText(this, "BlinkOCR is supported!", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
} else {
	Toast.makeText(this, "BlinkOCR is not supported! Reason: " + supportStatus.name(), Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
}
```

However, some recognizers require camera with autofocus. If you try to start recognition with those recognizers on a device that does not have camera with autofocus, you will get an error. To prevent that, when you prepare the array with recognition settings (see [Recognition settings and results](#recognitionSettingsAndResults) for settings reference), you can easily filter out all settings that require autofocus from array using the following code snippet:

```java
// setup array of recognition settings (described in chapter "Recognition 
// settings and results")
RecognizerSettings[] settArray = setupSettingsArray();
if(!RecognizerCompatibility.cameraHasAutofocus(CameraType.CAMERA_BACKFACE, this)) {
	setarr = RecognizerSettingsUtils.filterOutRecognizersThatRequireAutofocus(setarr);
}
```

## <a name="recognizerView"></a> Embedding `RecognizerView` into custom scan activity
This section will discuss how to embed `RecognizerView` into your scan activity and perform scan.

1. First make sure that `RecognizerView` is a member field in your activity. This is required because you will need to pass all activity's lifecycle events to `RecognizerView`.
2. It is recommended to keep your scan activity in one orientation, such as `portrait` or `landscape`. Setting `sensor` as scan activity's orientation will trigger full restart of activity whenever device orientation changes. This will provide very poor user experience because both camera and _BlinkOCR_ native library will have to be restarted every time. There are measures for this behaviour and will be discussed [later](#scanOrientation).
3. In your activity's `onCreate` method, create a new `RecognizerView`, define its [settings and listeners](#recognizerViewReference) and then call its `create` method. After that, add your views that should be layouted on top of camera view.
4. Override your activity's `onStart`, `onResume`, `onPause`, `onStop` and `onDestroy` methods and call `RecognizerView's` lifecycle methods `start`, `resume`, `pause`, `stop` and `destroy`. This will ensure correct camera and native resource management. If you plan to manage `RecognizerView's` lifecycle independently of host activity's lifecycle, make sure the order of calls to lifecycle methods is the same as is with activities (i.e. you should not call `resume` method if `create` and `start` were not called first).

Here is the minimum example of integration of `RecognizerView` as the only view in your activity:

```java
public class MyScanActivity extends Activity implements ScanResultListener, CameraEventsListener {
	private RecognizerView mRecognizerView;
		
	@Override
	protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
		// create RecognizerView
		mRecognizerView = new RecognizerView(this);
		   
		// setup array of recognition settings (described in chapter "Recognition 
		// settings and results")
		RecognizerSettings[] settArray = setupSettingsArray();
		if(!RecognizerCompatibility.cameraHasAutofocus(CameraType.CAMERA_BACKFACE, this)) {
			setarr = RecognizerSettingsUtils.filterOutRecognizersThatRequireAutofocus(setarr);
		}
		mRecognizerView.setRecognitionSettings(settings);
		
        // set license key
        mRecognizerView.setLicenseKey("your license key here");
           
		// scan result listener will be notified when scan result gets available
		mRecognizerView.setScanResultListener(this);
		// camera events listener will be notified about camera lifecycle and errors
		mRecognizerView.setCameraEventsListener(this);
		
		// set camera aspect mode
		// ASPECT_FIT will fit the camera preview inside the view
		// ASPECT_FILL will zoom and crop the camera preview, but will use the
		// entire view surface
		mRecognizerView.setAspectMode(CameraAspectMode.ASPECT_FILL);
		   
		mRecognizerView.create();
		setContentView(mRecognizerView);
	}
	
	@Override
	protected void onStart() {
	   super.onStart();
	   // you need to pass all activity's lifecycle methods to RecognizerView
	   mRecognizerView.start();
	}
	
	@Override
	protected void onResume() {
	   super.onResume();
	   // you need to pass all activity's lifecycle methods to RecognizerView
	   mRecognizerView.resume();
	}

	@Override
	protected void onPause() {
	   super.onPause();
	   // you need to pass all activity's lifecycle methods to RecognizerView
	   mRecognizerView.pause();
	}

	@Override
	protected void onStop() {
	   super.onStop();
	   // you need to pass all activity's lifecycle methods to RecognizerView
	   mRecognizerView.stop();
	}
	
	@Override
	protected void onDestroy() {
	   super.onDestroy();
	   // you need to pass all activity's lifecycle methods to RecognizerView
	   mRecognizerView.destroy();
	}

	@Override
	public void onConfigurationChanged(Configuration newConfig) {
	   super.onConfigurationChanged(newConfig);
	   // you need to pass all activity's lifecycle methods to RecognizerView
	   mRecognizerView.changeConfiguration(newConfig);
	}
	
    @Override
    public void onScanningDone(BaseRecognitionResult[] dataArray, RecognitionType recognitionType) {
    	// this method is from ScanResultListener and will be called when scanning completes
    	// multiple scan results may be returned, depending on generic settings that define
    	// whether all found objects should be returned or only the first one (see subchapter
    	// "Generic settings" in chapter "Recognition settings and results")
    	
    	// When this method gets called, scanning gets paused. To resume scanning after this
    	// method has been called, call resumeScanning method.
    	mRecognizerView.resumeScanning();
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onCameraPreviewStarted() {
        // this method is from CameraEventsListener and will be called when camera preview starts
    }

    @Override
    public void onStartupError(Throwable exc) {

```

### <a name="scanOrientation"></a> Scan activity's orientation

If activity's `screenOrientation` property in `AndroidManifest.xml` is set to `sensor`, `fullSensor` or similar, activity will be restarted every time device changes orientation from portrait to landscape and vice versa. While restarting activity, its `onPause`, `onStop` and `onDestroy` methods will be called and then new activity will be created anew. This is a potential problem for scan activity because in its lifecycle it controls both camera and native library - restarting the activity will trigger both restart of the camera and native library. This is a problem because changing orientation from landscape to portrait and vice versa will be very slow, thus degrading a user experience. **We do not recommend such setting.**

For that matter, we recommend setting your scan activity to either `portrait` or `landscape` mode and handle device orientation changes manually. To help you with this, `RecognizerView` supports adding child views to it that will be rotated regardless of activity's `screenOrientation`. You add a view you wish to be rotated (such as view that contains buttons, status messages, etc.) to `RecognizerView` with `addChildView` method. The second parameter of the method is a boolean that defines whether the view you are adding will be rotated with device. To define allowed orientations, implement [OrientationAllowedListener](javadoc/com/microblink/view/OrientationAllowedListener.html) interface and add it to `RecognizerView` with method `setOrientationAllowedListener`. **This is the recommended way of rotating camera overlay.**

However, if you really want to set `screenOrientation` property to `sensor` or similar and want Android to handle orientation changes of your scan activity, then we recommend to set `configChanges` property of your activity to `orientation|screenSize`. This will tell Android not to restart your activity when device orientation changes. Instead, activity's `onConfigurationChanged` method will be called so that activity can be notified of the configuration change. In your implementation of this method, you should call `changeConfiguration` method of `RecognizerView` so it can adapt its camera surface and child views to new configuration. Note that on Android versions older than 4.0 changing of configuration will require restart of camera, which can be slow.

__Important__

If you use `sensor` or similar screen orientation for your scan activity there is a catch. No matter if your activity is set to be restarted on configuration change or only notified via `onConfigurationChanged` method, if your activity's orientation is changed from `portrait` to `reversePortrait` or from `landscape` to `reverseLandscape` or vice versa, your activity will not be notified of this change in any way - it will not be neither restarted nor `onConfigurationChanged` will be called - the views in your activity will just be rotated by 180 degrees. This is a problem because it will make your camera preview upside down. In order to fix this, you first need to [find a way how to get notified of this change](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9909037/how-to-detect-screen-rotation-through-180-degrees-from-landscape-to-landscape-or) and then you should call `changeConfiguration` method of `RecognizerView` so it will correct camera preview orientation.

## <a name="recognizerViewReference"></a> `RecognizerView` reference
The complete reference of `RecognizerView` is available in [Javadoc](javadoc/com/microblink/view/recognition/RecognizerView.html). The usage example is provided in `` demo app provided with SDK. This section just gives a quick overview of `RecognizerView's` most important methods.

##### `create()`
This method should be called in activity's `onCreate` method. It will initialize `RecognizerView's` internal fields and will initialize camera control thread. This method must be called after all other settings are already defined, such as listeners and recognition settings. After calling this method, you can add child views to `RecognizerView` with method `addChildView(View, boolean)`.

##### `start()`
This method should be called in activity's `onStart` method. It will initialize background processing thread and start native library initialization on that thread.

##### `resume()`
This method should be called in activity's `onResume` method. It will trigger background initialization of camera.

##### `pause()`
This method should be called in activity's `onPause` method. It will stop the camera, but will keep native library loaded.

##### `stop()`
This method should be called in activity's `onStop` method. It will deinitialize native library, terminate background processing thread and free all resources that are no longer necessary.

##### `destroy()`
This method should be called in activity's `onDestroy` method. It will free all resources allocated in `create()` and will terminate camera control thread.

##### `changeConfiguration(Configuration)`
This method should be called in activity's `onConfigurationChanged` method. It will adapt camera surface to new configuration without the restart of the activity. See [Scan activity's orientation](#scanOrientation) for more information.

##### `setCameraType(CameraType)`
With this method you can define which camera on device will be used. Default camera used is back facing camera.

##### `setAspectMode(CameraAspectMode)`
Define the aspect mode of camera. If set to `ASPECT_FIT` (default), then camera preview will be fit inside available view space. If set to `ASPECT_FILL`, camera preview will be zoomed and cropped to use the entire view space.

##### `setRecognitionSettings(RecognizerSettings[])`
With this method you can set the array of `RecognizerSettings` objects. Those objects will contain information about what will be scanned and how will scan be performed. For more information about recognition settings and results see [Recognition settings and results](#recognitionSettingsAndResults). This method must be called before `create()`.

##### `setGenericRecognizerSettings(GenericRecognizerSettings)`
With this method you can set the generic settings that will be affect all enabled recognizers or the whole recognition process. For more information about generic settings, see [Generic settings](#genericSettings). This method must be called before `create()`.

##### `reconfigureRecognizers(RecognizerSettings[], GenericRecognizerSettings)`
With this method you can reconfigure the recognition process while recognizer is active. Unlike `setRecognitionSettings` and `setGenericRecognizerSettings`, this method can be called while recognizer is active (i.e. after `resume` was called), but paused (either `pauseScanning` was called or `onScanningDone` callback is being handled). For more information about recognition settings see [Recognition settings and results](#recognitionSettingsAndResults).

##### `reconfigureRecognizers(RecognizerSettings[])`
With this method you can reconfigure the recognition process while recognizer is active. Unlike `setRecognitionSettings`, this method can be called while recognizer is active (i.e. after `resume` was called), but paused (either `pauseScanning` was called or `onScanningDone` callback is being handled). For more information about recognition settings see [Recognition settings and results](#recognitionSettingsAndResults).

##### `setOrientationAllowedListener(OrientationAllowedListener)`
With this method you can set a [OrientationAllowedListener](javadoc/com/microblink/view/OrientationAllowedListener.html) which will be asked if current orientation is allowed. If orientation is allowed, it will be used to rotate rotatable views to it and it will be passed to native library so that recognizers can be aware of the new orientation.

##### `setRecognizerViewEventListener(RecognizerViewEventListener)`
With this method you can set a [RecognizerViewEventListener](javadoc/com/microblink/view/recognition/RecognizerViewEventListener.html) which will be notified when certain recognition events occur, such as when object has been detected.

##### `setScanResultListener(ScanResultListener)`
With this method you can set a [ScanResultListener](javadoc/com/microblink/view/recognition/ScanResultListener.html) which will be notified when recognition completes. After recognition completes, `RecognizerView` will pause its scanning loop and to continue the scanning you will have to call `resumeScanning` method. In this method you can obtain data from scanning results. For more information see [Recognition settings and results](#recognitionSettingsAndResults).

##### `setCameraEventsListener(CameraEventsListener)`
With this method you can set a [CameraEventsListener](javadoc/com/microblink/view/CameraEventsListener.html) which will be notified when various camera events occur, such as when camera preview has started, autofocus has failed or there has been an error while starting the camera.

##### `pauseScanning()`
This method pauses the scanning loop, but keeps both camera and native library initialized. This method is called internally when scan completes before `onScanningDone` is called.

##### `resumeScanning()`
With this method you can resume the paused scanning loop. This method implicitly calls `resetRecognitionState()`.

##### `resumeScanningWithoutStateReset()`
With this method you can resume the paused scanning loop without resetting recognition state. Be aware that after resuming, old recognition state might be reused for boosting recognition result. This may not be always a desired behaviour.

##### `resetRecognitionState()`
With this method you can reset internal recognition state. State is usually kept to improve recognition quality over time, but without resetting recognition state sometimes you might get poorer results (for example if you scan one object and then another without resetting state you might end up with result that contains properties from both scanned objects).

##### `addChildView(View, boolean)`
With this method you can add your own view on top of `RecognizerView`. `RecognizerView` will ensure that your view will be layouted exactly above camera preview surface (which can be letterboxed if aspect ratio of camera preview size does not match the aspect ratio of `RecognizerView` and camera aspect mode is set to `ASPECT_FIT`). Boolean parameter defines whether your view should be rotated with device orientation changes. The rotation is independent of host activity's orientation changes and allowed orientations will be determined from [OrientationAllowedListener](javadoc/com/microblink/view/OrientationAllowedListener.html). See also [Scan activity's orientation](#scanOrientation) for more information why you should rotate your views independently of activity.

##### `isCameraFocused()` 
This method returns `true` if camera thinks it has focused on object. Note that camera has to be loaded for this method to work.

##### `focusCamera()` 
This method requests camera to perform autofocus. If camera does not support autofocus feature, method does nothing. Note that camera has to be loaded for this method to work.

##### `isCameraTorchSupported()` 
This method returns `true` if camera supports torch flash mode. Note that camera has to be loaded for this method to work.

##### `setTorchState(boolean, SuccessCallback)` 
If torch flash mode is supported on camera, this method can be used to enable/disable torch flash mode. After operation is performed, [SuccessCallback](javadoc/com/microblink/hardware/SuccessCallback.html) will be called with boolean indicating whether operation has succeeded or not. Note that camera has to be loaded for this method to work and that callback might be called on background non-UI thread.

##### `setScanningRegion(Rectangle, boolean)`
You can use this method to define the scanning region and define whether this scanning region will be rotated with device if [OrientationAllowedListener](javadoc/com/microblink/view/OrientationAllowedListener.html) determines that orientation is allowed. This is useful if you have your own camera overlay on top of `RecognizerView` that is set as rotatable view - you can thus synchronize the rotation of the view with the rotation of the scanning region native code will scan.

Scanning region is defined as [Rectangle](javadoc/com/microblink/geometry/Rectangle.html). First parameter of rectangle is x-coordinate represented as percentage of view width, second parameter is y-coordinate represented as percentage of view height, third parameter is region width represented as percentage of view width and fourth parameter is region height represented as percentage of view height.

View width and height are defined in current context, i.e. they depend on screen orientation. If you allow your ROI view to be rotated, then in portrait view width will be smaller than height, whilst in landscape orientation width will be larger than height. This complies with view designer preview. If you choose not to rotate your ROI view, then your ROI view will be laid out either in portrait or landscape, depending on setting for your scan activity in `AndroidManifest.xml`

Note that scanning region only reflects to native code - it does not have any impact on user interface. You are required to create a matching user interface that will visualize the same scanning region you set here.

##### `setLicenseKey(String licenseKey)`
This method sets the license key that will unlock all features of the native library. You can obtain your license key from [Microblink website](http://microblink.com/login).

##### `setLicenseKey(String licenseKey, String licenseOwner)`
Use this method to set a license key that is bound to a license owner, not the application package name. You will use this method when you obtain a license key that allows you to use _BlinkOCR_ SDK in multiple applications. You can obtain your license key from [Microblink website](http://microblink.com/login).

## <a name="directAPI"></a> Using direct API for recognition of android Bitmaps

This section will describe how to use direct API to recognize android Bitmaps without the need for camera. You can use direct API anywhere from your application, not just from activities.

1. First, you need to obtain reference to [Recognizer singleton](javadoc/com/microblink/directApi/Recognizer.html).
2. Second, you need to initialize the recognizer.
3. After initialization, you can use singleton to process images. You cannot process multiple images in parallel.
4. Do not forget to terminate the recognizer after usage (it is a shared resource).

Here is the minimum example of usage of direct API for recognizing android Bitmap:

```java
public class DirectAPIActivity extends Activity implements ScanResultListener {
	private Recognizer mRecognizer;
		
	@Override
	protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
		// initialize your activity here
	}
	
	@Override
	protected void onStart() {
	   super.onStart();
	   mRecognizer = Recognizer.getSingletonInstance();
		
	   // set license key
	   boolean success = mRecognizer.setLicenseKey(this, "your license key");
	   if (!success) {
	   		return;
	   }

		// setupSettingsArray method is described in chapter "Recognition 
		// settings and results")
		mRecognizer.initialize(this, null, setupSettingsArray());
	}
	
	@Override
	protected void onResume() {
	   super.onResume();
		// start recognition
		Bitmap bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeFile("/path/to/some/file.jpg");
		mRecognizer.recognize(bitmap, this);
	}

	@Override
	protected void onStop() {
	   super.onStop();
	   mRecognizer.terminate();
	}

    @Override
    public void onScanningDone(BaseRecognitionResult[] dataArray, RecognitionType recognitionType) {
    	// this method is from ScanResultListener and will be called when scanning completes
    	// multiple scan results may be returned, depending on generic settings that define

# <a name="recognitionSettingsAndResults"></a> Recognition settings and results

This chapter will discuss various recognition settings used to configure different recognizers and scan results generated by them.

## <a name="genericSettings"></a> Generic settings

Generic settings affect all enabled recognizers and the whole recognition process. The complete reference can be found in [javadoc](javadoc/com/microblink/recognizers/settings/GenericRecognizerSettings.html). Here is the list of methods that are most relevant:

##### `setAllowMultipleScanResultsOnSingleImage(boolean)`
Sets whether or not outputting of multiple scan results from same image is allowed. If that is `true`, it is possible to return multiple recognition results from same image. By default, this option is `false`, i.e. the array of `BaseRecognitionResults` will contain at most 1 element. The upside of setting that option to `false` is the speed - if you enable lots of recognizers, as soon as the first recognizer succeeds in scanning, recognition chain will be terminated and other recognizers will not get a chance to analyze the image. The downside is that you are then unable to obtain multiple results from single image.

##### `setNumMsBeforeTimeout(int)`
Sets the number of miliseconds _BlinkOCR_ will attempt to perform the scan it exits with timeout error. On timeout returned array of `BaseRecognitionResults` might be null, empty or may contain only elements that are not valid (`isValid` returns `false`) or are empty (`isEmpty` returns `true`).

## <a name="blinkOCR"></a> Scanning segments with BlinkOCR recognizer

This section discusses the setting up of BlinkOCR recognizer and obtaining results from it. You should also check the `BlinkOCRApp` demo for example.

### Setting up BlinkOCR recognizer

BlinkOCR recognizer is consisted of one or more parsers that are grouped in parser groups. Each parser knows how to extract certain element from OCR result and also knows what are the best OCR engine options required to perform OCR on image. Parsers can be grouped in parser groups. Parser groups contain one or more parsers and are responsible for merging required OCR engine options of each parser in group and performing OCR only once and then letting each parser in group parse the data. Thus, you can make for own best tradeoff between speed and accuracy - putting each parser into its own group will give best accuracy, but will perform OCR of image for each parser which can consume a lot of processing time. On the other hand, putting all parsers into same group will perform only one OCR but with settings that are combined for all parsers in group, thus possibly reducing parsing quality.

Let's see this on example: assume we have two parsers at our disposal: `AmountParser` and `EMailParser`. `AmountParser` knows how to extract amount's from OCR result and requires from OCR only to recognise digits, periods and commas and ignore letters. On the other hand, `EMailParser` knows how to extract e-mails from OCR result and requires from OCR to recognise letters, digits, '@' characters and periods, but not commas. 

If we put both `AmountParser` and `EMailParser` into same parser group, the merged OCR engine settings will require recognition od all letters, all digits, '@' character, both period and comma. Such OCR result will contain all characters for `EMailParser` to properly parse e-mail, but might confuse `AmountParser` if OCR misclassifies some characters into digits.

If we put `AmountParser` in one parser group and `EMailParser` in another parser group, OCR will be performed for each parser group independently, thus preventing the `AmountParser` confusion, but two OCR passes of image will be performed, which can have a performance impact.

So to sum it up, BlinkOCR recognizer performs OCR of image for each available parser group and then runs all parsers in that group on obtained OCR result and saves parsed data. 

By definition, each parser results with string that represents a parsed data. The parsed string is stored under parser's name which has to be unique within parser group. So, when defining settings for BlinkOCR recognizer, when adding parsers, you need to provide a name for the parser (you will use that name for obtaining result later) and optionally provide a name for the parser group in which parser will be put into.

To activate BlinkOCR recognizer, you need to create [BlinkOCRRecognizerSettings](javadoc/com/microblink/recognizers/ocr/blinkocr/BlinkOCRRecognizerSettings.html), add some parsers to it and add it to `RecognizerSettings` array. You can use the following code snippet to perform that:

```java
private RecognizerSettings[] setupSettingsArray() {
	BlinkOCRRecognizerSettings sett = new BlinkOCRRecognizerSettings();
	
	// add amount parser to default parser group
	sett.addParser("myAmountParser", new AmountParserSettings());
	
	// now add sett to recognizer settings array that is used to configure
	// recognition
	return new RecognizerSettings[] { sett };
}
```

The following is a list of available parsers:


- Amount parser - represented by [AmountParserSettings](javadoc/com/microblink/recognizers/ocr/blinkocr/parser/generic/AmountParserSettings.html)
	- used for parsing amounts from OCR result
- IBAN parser - represented by [IbanParserSettings](javadoc/com/microblink/recognizers/ocr/blinkocr/parser/generic/IbanParserSettings.html)
	- used for parsing International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs) from OCR result
- Raw parser - represented by [RawParserSettings](javadoc/com/microblink/recognizers/ocr/blinkocr/parser/generic/RawParserSettings.html)
	- used for obtaining raw OCR result

### Obtaining results from BlinkOCR recognizer

BlinkOCR recognizer produces [BlinkOCRRecognitionResult](javadoc/com/microblink/recognizers/ocr/blinkocr/BlinkOCRRecognitionResult.html). You can use `instanceof` operator to check if element in results array is instance of `BlinkOCRRecognitionResult` class. See the following snipper for an example:

```java
@Override
public void onScanningDone(BaseRecognitionResult[] dataArray, RecognitionType recognitionType) {
	for(BaseRecognitionResult baseResult : dataArray) {
		if(baseResult instanceof BlinkOCRRecognitionResult) {
			BlinkOCRRecognitionResult result = (BlinkOCRRecognitionResult) baseResult;
			
	        // you can use getters of BlinkOCRRecognitionResult class to 
	        // obtain scanned information
	        if(result.isValid() && !result.isEmpty()) {
	        	 // use the parser name provided to BlinkOCRRecognizerSettings to
	        	 // obtain parsed result provided by given parser
	        	 // obtain result of "myAmountParser" in default parsing group
		        String parsedAmount = result.getParsedResult("myAmountParser");
		        // note that parsed result can be null or empty even if result
		        // is marked as non-empty and valid
		        if(parsedAmount != null && !parsedAmount.isEmpty()) {
		        	// do whatever you want with parsed result
		        }
		        // obtain OCR result for default parsing group
		        // OCR result exists if result is valid and non-empty
		        OcrResult ocrResult = result.getOcrResult();
	        } else {
	        	// not all relevant data was scanned, ask user
	        	// to try again
	        }
		}
	}
}
```

Available getters are:

##### `boolean isValid()`
Returns `true` if scan result contains at least one OCR result in one parsing group.

##### `boolean isEmpty()`
Returns `true` if scan result is empty, i.e. nothing was scanned. All getters should return `null` for empty result.

##### `String getParsedResult(String parserName)`
Returns the parsed result provided by parser with name `parserName` added to default parser group. If parser with name `parserName` does not exists in default parser group, returns `null`. If parser exists, but has failed to parse any data, returns empty string.

##### `String getParsedResult(String parserGroupName, String parserName)`
Returns the parsed result provided by parser with name `parserName` added to parser group named `parserGroupName`. If parser with name `parserName` does not exists in parser group with name `parserGroupName` or if parser group does not exists, returns `null`. If parser exists, but has failed to parse any data, returns empty string.

##### `OcrResult getOcrResult()`
Returns the [OCR result](javadoc/com/microblink/results/ocr/OcrResult.html) structure for default parser group.

##### `OcrResult getOcrResult(String parserGroupName)`
Returns the [OCR result](javadoc/com/microblink/results/ocr/OcrResult.html) structure for parser group named `parserGroupName`.

# <a name="archConsider"></a> Processor architecture considerations

_BlinkOCR_ is distributed with both ARMv6, ARMv7 and x86 native library binaries.

ARMv7 architecture gives the ability to take advantage of hardware accelerated floating point operations and SIMD processing with [NEON](http://www.arm.com/products/processors/technologies/neon.php). This gives _BlinkOCR_ a huge performance boost on devices that have ARMv7 processors. Most new devices (all since 2012.) have ARMv7 processor so it makes little sense not to take advantage of performance boosts that those processors can give. 

x86 architecture gives the ability to obtain native speed on x86 android devices, like [Prestigio 5430](http://www.gsmarena.com/prestigio_multiphone_5430_duo-5721.php). Without that, _BlinkOCR_ will not work on such devices, or it will be run on top of ARM emulator that is shipped with device - this will give a huge performance penalty.

However, there are some issues to be considered:

- ARMv7 processors understand ARMv6 instruction set, but ARMv6 processors do not understand ARMv7 instructions.
- if ARMv7 processor executes ARMv6 code, it does not take advantage of hardware floating point acceleration and does not use SIMD operations
- ARMv7 build of native library cannot be run on devices that do not have ARMv7 compatible processor (list of those old devices can be found [here](http://www.getawesomeinstantly.com/list-of-armv5-armv6-and-armv5-devices/))
- neither ARMv6 nor ARMv7 processors understand x86 instruction set
- x86 processors do not understand neither ARMv6 nor ARMv7 instruction sets
- however, some x86 android devices ship with the builtin [ARM emulator](http://commonsware.com/blog/2013/11/21/libhoudini-what-it-means-for-developers.html) - such devices are able to run ARM binaries (both ARMv6 and ARMv7) but with performance penalty. There is also a risk that builtin ARM emulator will not understand some specific ARM instruction and will crash.

`LibRecognizer.aar` archive contains both ARMv6, ARMv7 and x86 builds of native library. By default, when you integrate _BlinkOCR_ into your app, your app will contain native builds for all processor architecture. Thus, _BlinkOCR_ will work on ARMv6 and x86 devices and will use ARMv7 features on ARMv7 devices. However, the size of your application will be rather large.

## <a name="reduceSize"></a> Reducing the final size of your app

If your final app is too large because of _BlinkOCR_, you can decide to create multiple flavors of your app - one flavor for ARMv6, one for ARMv7 and one for x86 devices. With gradle and Android studio this is very easy - just add the following code to `build.gradle` file of your app:

```
productFlavors {
   x86 {
       ndk {
           abiFilter "x86"
       }
   }
   armv7 {
       ndk {
           abiFilter "armeabi-v7a"
       }
   }
   arm {
       ndk {
           abiFilter "armeabi"
       }
   }
}
```

With that build instructions, gradle will build three different APK files for your app. Each APK will contain only native library for one processor architecture. You can find more information about multiple APK support in Google Play Store on [this link](https://developer.android.com/google/play/publishing/multiple-apks.html).

However, if you are using Eclipse, things get complicated. Eclipse does not support build flavors and you will either need to remove support for some processors or create three different library projects from `LibRecognizer.aar` - each one for specific processor architecture. In the next section, we will discuss how to remove processor architecture support from Eclipse library project.

### Removing processor architecture support in Eclipse

This section assumes that you have set up and prepared your Eclipse project from `LibRecognizer.aar` as described in chapter [Eclipse integration instructions](#eclipseIntegration).

Native libraryies in eclipse library project are located in subfolder `libs`:

- `libs/armeabi` contains native libraries for ARMv6 processor architecture
- `libs/armeabi-v7a` contains native libraries for ARMv7 processor arhitecture
- `libs/x86` contains native libraries for x86 processor architecture

To remove a support for processor architecture, you should simply delete appropriate folder inside Eclipse library project:

- to remove ARMv6 support, delete folder `libs/armeabi`
- to remove ARMv7 support, delete folder `libs/armeabi-v7a`
- to remove x86 support, delete folder `libs/x86`

### Consequences of removing processor architecture

However, removing a processor architecture has some consequences:

- by removing ARMv6 support _BlinkOCR_ will not work on devices that have ARMv6 processors. 
- by removing ARMv7 support, _BlinkOCR_ will work on both devices that have ARMv6 and ARMv7 processor. However, on ARMv7 processors, hardware floating point and SIMD acceleration will not be used, thus making _BlinkOCR_ much slower. Our internal tests have shown that running ARMv7 version of _BlinkOCR_ on ARMv7 device is more than 50% faster than running ARMv6 version on same device.
- by removing x86 support, _BlinkOCR_ will not work on devices that have x86 processor, except in situations when devices have ARM emulator - in that case, _BlinkOCR_ will work, but will be slow

Our recommendation is to include both ARMv6, ARMv7 and x86 versions into your app - it will work on all devices and will provide best user experience. However, if you really need to reduce the size of your app, we recommend releasing three versions of your app - one version with only ARMv6 version for old devices, one version with only ARMv7 version for new devices and one version with only x86 version for those rare x86 devices.

## <a name="combineNativeLibraries"></a> Combining _BlinkOCR_ with other native libraries

If you are combining _BlinkOCR_ library with some other libraries that contain native code into your application, make sure you match the architectures of all native libraries. For example, if third party library has got only ARMv6 and x86 versions, you must use exactly ARMv6 and x86 versions of _BlinkOCR_ with that library, but not ARMv7. Using ARMv7 will most definitely crash your app in initialization step on some devices because it will try to load all its native dependencies in same preferred architecture - for example Nexus 4 preferres ARMv7 native libraries so it will see that there is a _BlinkOCR_ ARMv7 native library and will load it. After that, it will try to load ARMv7 version of your third party library which does not exist - therefore app will crash with `UnsatisfiedLinkException`.

# <a name="troubleshoot"></a> Troubleshooting

In case of problems with using the SDK, you should do as follows:

* enable logging to get the ability to see what is library doing. To enable logging, put this line in your application:

	```java
	com.microblink.util.Log.setLogLevel(com.microblink.util.Log.LogLevel.LOG_VERBOSE);
	```

After this line, library will display as much information about its work as possible. Make sure to remove this line in your production code as lots of log outputs may slow down the performance of library.
